DCCP-SYNDISC: Scalable extension of SYNDISC using Disciplined Convex-Concave Programming (DCCP)
====================================================

This package provides a scalable extension of the original SYNDISC algorithm using Disciplined Convex-Concave Programming (DCCP). This repository contains the companion software for the MEng Individual Project at Imperial College London.

The additional software is organised as follows:

- `dccp-syndisc/` contains the main implementation of the DCCP-SYNDISC algorithm:
  - `dccp_syndisc.py` contains the main implementation of the DCCP-SYNDISC algorithm.
  - `dccp_utils.py` contains utility functions used in the DCCP-SYNDISC algorithm.
  - `hpc_experiments/` contain the scripts used to run the real-world data experiments on the HPC cluster.
  - `corr_and_gate.py` contains a minimal example of the DCCP-SYNDISC algorithm on a simple distribution, replicating the AND gate example from the original SYNDISC paper.
  - `experiment_results/` contains the evaluation results on real-world data obtained by running the scripts in `hpc_experiments/`.
  - `discrete_testing/` contains the evaluation results on synthetic data obtained by running `synthetic_data_tests.py`.

- `syndisc_continuous/` contains a proof-of-concept implementation of the synergy measure described in the paper below to continuous distributions. This is a standalone piece of software that can be used to compute the synergy measure for continuous distributions. The package is organised as follows:
  - `arbitrary_target.py` contains the main implementation of the SYNDISC algorithm for continuous distributions with an arbitrary target variable. This contains three examples: varying the grid size, varying the correlation between sources, and varying the correlation between the sources and the target. 
  - `self_disclosure.py` contains the main implementation of the SYNDISC algorithm for continuous distributions with the target variable being the source set. This contains three examples: varying the grid size, sources following a Gaussian copula, and sources following a Gumbel copula.
  - `gaussian_copula_plot.py` contains a simple script to plot the Gaussian copula used in the continuous distribution experiments.

SYNDISC: SYNergistic information via data DISClosure
====================================================

This package provides complete functionality to compute synergistic information
via privacy-preserving data disclosure. This repository contains the companion
software for the paper:

F. Rosas\*, P. Mediano\*, B. Rassouli and A. Barrett (2019). An operational
information decomposition via synergistic disclosure. https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10387

Description and basic intuitions
--------------------------------

Under the hood, the computation of synergistic disclosure proceeds in two steps:

1. Compute the set of synergistic channels, p(V|X), that do not disclose
information about any of the individual variables X_i. That is: I(V; X_i) = 0
for all i.

2. Compute synergistic disclosure as the maximum information about Y that can
be obtained through a synergistic channel on X. That is, max I(V; Y) subject to
V being a synergistic observable of X. In other words: how much information can
X provide about Y without "compromising" the individual X_i's?

In practice, step 1 is computed using tools from computational geometry (since
the set of synergistic channels is related to the vertices of a polytope), and
step 2 can be optimised with a standard Linear Programming (LP) solver.

This idea can be readily generalised to arbitrary ``constraint sets'' -- sets
of variables the information of which cannot be disclosed. For example, for
n=3 source variables, C(X, {1}{2}{3}) is the set of channels that does not
provide any information about any individual variable; and C(X, {1,2}) is the
set of channels that provides no information about the joint distribution of
X_1 and X_2 (but may disclose information about X_3).

See the main paper and references below for a detailed description of the
measure.

Examples
--------

The package aims to provide a lean interface to the key functions that compute
the synergistic disclosure as described in the paper above. The main point of
access to the code is the `disclosure()` function, which takes a
`dit.Distribution` as argument:

```python
import dit
from syndisc import disclosure

XOR = dit.example_dists.Xor()
print('Synergy in XOR: ', disclosure(XOR))

COPY = dit.example_dists.giant_bit()
print('Synergy in COPY: ', disclosure(COPY))
```

By default, for a distribution of n+1 variables, `disclosure()` uses the
first n as sources, the last one as target, and uses the constraint set
`{1}{2}...{n}`. These can be changed via optional arguments:

```python
dblxor = dit.pid.distributions.trivariate.dblxor
disclosure(dblxor)
disclosure(dblxor, cons=[[0,1]])
```

The practical limit of this algorithm is on around n=7 binary source
variables, after which the computation of the set of synergistic channels
becomes infeasible.

Finally, the package also implements a full information decomposition similar
to Williams and Beer's Partial Information Decomposition (PID):

```python
from syndisc.pid import PID_SD

AND = dit.example_dists.And()
print(PID_SD(AND))
```

Further examples can be found in the `examples/` folder.


Download and installation
-------------------------

The package can be installed via standard `distutils` functionality.

```
$ python setup.py install
```

This may need root (i.e. `sudo`) permissions, depending on your Python
environment configuration.

Pytest-compatible tests are provided in the `tests/` subfolder.

Requirements
------------

This package depends heavily on two other packages:

* `dit`, a general-purpose information theory package used for general handling
of probability distributions.

* `pypoman`, a computational geometry package used to find the set of
synergistic channels for a set of sources.

In addition, it depends on other common packages (i.e. numpy, scipy, etc). All
of these are specified in the `setup.py` file.

This software is distributed under the modified 3-clause BSD Licence.
